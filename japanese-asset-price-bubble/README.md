This is a website about Japan's bubble economy, consisting of five pages. Users can navigate between these pages in a planned manner, but cannot jump to any random page. Because the theme is the bubble economy, many elements on the page are related to bubbles, and bright colors are used for accents. The text on the website briefly describes the bubble economy. What I'm most proud of is the trapezoidal text display on one page.
I think HTML & CSS is a challenging programming language, and I encountered many problems during the development process, but I used https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML to help me.
If I had more time, I would make the website more artistic, the overall feel more magical, the transitions between pages more diverse, and even add more theme-related interactions to each page.
