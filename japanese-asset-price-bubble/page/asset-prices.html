                    The 1985-1991 asset price bubble affected the entire nation, though the differences in the impact depended on three main factors: the size of the city, the geographical distance from Tokyo metropolis and Osaka, and the historical importance of the city in the central government's policy. Cities within prefectures closer to the Tokyo metropolis experienced far greater asset price inflation compared to cities located in prefectures further from the Tokyo metropolis.

                    For definition purposes, the Japan Real Estate Institute has classified Tokyo metropolis (including 23 special wards), Yokohama (Kanagawa), Nagoya (Aichi), Kyoto (Kyoto), Osaka (Osaka), and Kobe (Hyogo) as the six major cities most impacted by the price bubble. These six major cities experienced far greater asset price inflation compared to other urban land nationwide. By 1991, commercial land prices rose <span class="number">302.9%</span> compared to 1985, while residential land and industrial land price jumped <span class="number">180.5%</span> and <span class="number">162.0%</span>, respectively, compared to 1985. Nationwide, statistics showed that commercial land, residential land, and industrial land prices were up by <span class="number">80.9%</span>, <span class="number">51.1%</span>, and <span class="number">51.7%</span>, respectively.

                    By the early 1980s, Tokyo was an important commercial city due to a high concentration of international financial corporations and interests. The demand for office space continued to soar as more economic activities flooded Tokyo commercial districts, resulting in demand outstripping supply. The government's policies that concentrated its economic activities in Tokyo, and the lack of diversification of economic activities in other local cities, are also partly to blame for the bubble.

                    By 1985, land within Tokyo commercial districts was insufficient to fulfill market demand. As a result, land prices in Tokyo commercial districts increased sharply within a year. The average price per 1 sq. meter for land in Tokyo commercial districts in 1984 was <span class="number">1,333,000¥</span> (U$<span class="number">5,600</span> assuming in 1984 that 1 U$=238¥). In just a year, the average price per 1 sq. meter for land in Tokyo commercial districts increased to <span class="number">1,894,000¥</span> (U$<span class="number">7,958</span> assuming in 1985 average 1 U$=238¥). This roughly translates to an increase of <span class="number">42%</span> over just a year. By 1986, the average price per 1 sq. meter for land in Tokyo commercial districts had risen as high as <span class="number">4,211,000¥</span> (U$<span class="number">25,065</span> assuming 1986 average 1 U$=168¥), a jump of <span class="number">122%</span> compared to 1985. Residential land jumped from an average <span class="number">297,000¥</span>/U$<span class="number">1,247</span> per 1 sq. meter (in 1985) to <span class="number">431,000¥</span>/U$<span class="number">2,565</span> per 1 sq. meter (in 1986), an increase of <span class="number">45%</span>.

                    Osaka also experienced rapid growth in land prices, especially in commercial districts. Land prices in Osaka gained <span class="number">35%</span> to a price of <span class="number">1,159,000¥</span>/1 sq. meter (1986) from an average <span class="number">855,000¥</span>/1 sq. meter (1985). Since Osaka served primarily as a commercial center in Japan, land prices in Osaka tend to be higher than those of most other urban lands in Japan.

                    By 1987, due to overwhelming demand, the price of residential land in Tokyo increased to <span class="number">890,000¥</span>/1 sq. meter (U$<span class="number">6,180</span> based on the assumption 1U$ = 144¥), and the price of commercial land increased to <span class="number">6,493,000¥</span>/1 sq. meter (U$<span class="number">45,090</span>). Consequently, investors flocked to prefectures surrounding the Tokyo metropolis, especially prefectures within the Greater Tokyo Area. Investors were more favorable to prefectures located in Southern Kanto than to Northern Kanto. Hence, land in cities like Yokohama (Kanagawa prefecture), Saitama (Saitama prefecture), and Chiba (Chiba prefecture) tended to be more expensive than cities like Mito (Ibaraki prefecture), Utsunomiya (Tochigi prefecture) and Maebashi (Gunma prefecture). For instance, in 1987, commercial land prices in Yokohama (average 1 sq. meter) were <span class="number">1,279,000¥</span>, Saitama were <span class="number">658,000¥</span> and Chiba were <span class="number">1,230,000¥</span>. On the other hand, commercial land prices in Mito (average 1 sq. meter) were <span class="number">153,000¥</span>, Utsunomiya were <span class="number">179,000¥</span> and Maebashi were <span class="number">135,000¥</span> in 1986.

                    Osaka land prices continued to increase, especially in the commercial area, as the prices increased to <span class="number">2,025,000¥</span>/1 sq. meter in 1987. Kyoto (Kyoto prefecture) and Kobe (Hyogo prefecture) also saw a sharp increase in land prices, especially in commercial areas that gained <span class="number">31%</span> and <span class="number">23%</span>, respectively. The effect of the bubble in Osaka spread as far as Nagoya (Aichi prefecture), which saw the commercial land prices gain as much as <span class="number">28%</span> compared to 1986.

                    The first sign of a possible bubble collapse appeared in 1988. By this time, non-prime land prices in Tokyo had reached their peak, though some areas in the Tokyo wards started to fall, albeit by a relatively small percentage. Prime land in Ginza district and areas in Central Tokyo continued to rise. Urban land in other cities at this point remained unaffected by the situation faced by the Tokyo metropolis. In Osaka, for instance, the commercial and residential land prices increased by <span class="number">37%</span> and <span class="number">41%</span> respectively.

                    By 1989, land prices in commercial districts in Tokyo began to stagnate, while land prices in residential areas in Tokyo actually dipped by <span class="number">4.2%</span> compared to 1988.[13] Land prices in prime areas in Tokyo also peaked around this time; Ginza district was the most expensive, peaking at <span class="number">30,000,000¥</span>/1 sq. meter (U$<span class="number">218,978</span> based on assumption 1U$ = 137¥). Yokohama (Kanagawa prefecture) experienced a slowdown due to its location closer to Tokyo. Saitama (Saitama) and Chiba (Chiba) still chalked up healthy gains in land prices. All other urban cities in Japan had yet to see the impact of a slowdown in Tokyo.

                    At their peak, prices in central Tokyo were such that the <span class="number">1.15</span> square kilometer Tokyo Imperial Palace grounds were estimated to be worth more than the entire real estate value of California.

                    Between 1990 and mid-1991, most urban lands had already reached their peak. The lag effect from the fall of Nikkei 225 pushed down the prices of urban land in most parts of Japan by the end of 1991. The bubble collapse was officially declared in early 1992 – as land prices dropped the most in this period. Tokyo experienced the worst of the catastrophe. Land prices in residential areas on average 1 sq/meter slid <span class="number">19%</span> while commercial land prices declined <span class="number">13%</span> compared to 1991. Overall land prices in residential areas and commercial districts in Tokyo fell to the lowest level since 1987.
