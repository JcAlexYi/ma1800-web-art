        Stock trading volumes accounted for by corporations rose from 19% to 39% during the 1980s, while cross ownership
        rose from 39% in 1950 to 67%. This reduced the number of shares available on the public markets for daily
        trading, making share prices easier to manipulate and detached from corporate leadership.

        In the 1980s, the direction of stock prices in Japan was largely determined by the asset market, particularly
        land prices, in Japan. Looking at the monthly performance of Nikkei 225 in 1984, the index largely moved within
        9900–11,600 range. As land prices in Tokyo began to rise in 1985, the stock market also moved higher. Indeed,
        the Nikkei 225 managed to rise past 13,000 by December 2, 1985.

        The major surge was obvious by 1986, as the Nikkei 225 gained close to 45% within a year. The trend continued
        throughout 1987 when it touched as high as 26,029 by early August before being dragged down by the NYSE Black
        Monday. The strong rally throughout 1988 and 1989 helped the Nikkei 225 touch another new record high at
        38,957.44 on December 29, 1989, before closing at 38,915.87. This translated to a gain of more than 224% since
        January 2, 1985. Some researchers concluded the unusual stock prices are likely due to the rise in land prices
        since the corporations' net assets increases, hence pushing the stock prices upward. As long as the asset prices
        continued to strengthen, investors would more likely be attracted to speculate on stock prices. However, this
        also portrays the weaknesses of corporate governance in Japan.

        On the downside, the tightening of monetary policy in 1989 seemed to affect stock prices. As lending costs
        increased drastically, coupled with a major slowdown in land prices in Tokyo, the stock market began to fall
        sharply in early 1990. The Nikkei 225 slid from an opening of 38,921 (January 4, 1990) to a yearly low of 21,902
        (December 5, 1990), which resulted in a loss of more than 43% within a year. Stock prices had officially
        collapsed by the end of 1990. The downward trend continued through the early 1990s, as the Nikkei 225 opened as
        low as 14,338 on August 19, 1992.
